This IMDB 5000 Dataset is originally generated by Chuan Sun (https://github.com/sundeepblue/movie_rating_prediction).

I reran the crawler with some minor modifications due to the change of structures from the website. I have the updated information of 
* Box Office (Domestic Gross and Worldwide Gross)
* IMDb Rating with the number of people who vote
* IMDb Reviews Number from both users and critics
by running
```
scrapy crawl movie_budget -o movie_budget_2018.json
```
```
scrapy crawl fetch_imdb_url -o fetch_imdb_url_2018.json
```
```
scrapy crawl imdb -o imdb_output_2018.json
```

I am not able to crawl or get data from Facebook, so I choose to keep them, and update other fields. Therefore, I need to combine the following files, in the data cleaning and profiling stage.
* `movie_budget_2018.json`
* `fetch_imdb_url_2018.json`
* `imdb_output_2018.json`
* `imdb_output_2017.json` (the original uncleaned dataset)

I moved them to Dumbo by
```
scp *.json xl2700@dumbo.es.its.nyu.edu:~/class9
```
and then put them to HDFS by
```
hdfs dfs -put *.json class9
```
